# RMUI Big Components - Overview [WIP]

A React big components library using Material UI.

_Create website quickly with RMUI Big Components._

## Introduction

RMUI Big components is an open-source React library that use [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

Big components are components that are composed of other components. They are not atomic components.

If you need atomic components, you can use [Material UI](https://mui.com/) along with RMUI Big Components.

The approach is to create components that are easy to use and quickly integrated, you just need to pass the props and the component will do the rest.

## Advantages

-   Create website quickly
-   Easy to use
-   Easy to customize
-   Easy to extend
